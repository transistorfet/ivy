* what bus to use?  VME or CompactPCI?
* CompactPCI connectors are kind of expensive and hard to get.  DIN 41612 are easier to get, but still pricey outside of 96-pins
* you could ues full CompactPCI, or CompactPCI on a DIN41612, or VME full cards (no), or VME on a 128 or 160-pin DIN41612, or VME but multiplexed on 96-pin

* especially if you're using a custom pinout bus, it would be nice to have a serial protocol on there, like SMBus(I2C), or JTAG

* you need transceivers anyways so multiplexing actually isn't that difficult.  It's mainly the issue with custom signaling, but you plan to use a CPLD

* there is some question of the I/O space, which will be different anyways, so the drivers will have to use different addresses.  It would be nice if the RAM could more easily be
  variable in size.  This would be ok if you reserved all of 0x00800000 to 0x00FFFFFF for onboard SRAM, and the lower area for I/O and flash, with everything above 0x01000000
  being on the bus
* where should the memory and I/O be mapped?  What if you had a bus that only used A24 space like VME allows? (ie. Z280 or something)
* I could add headers for a 41612 connector along side the pin headers, with the idea of maybe using this card in a backplane for a single CPU/multi card computer
  and the bus arbitration stuff can be on the backplane.  The big question is at what point would I need drivers on the bus lines
